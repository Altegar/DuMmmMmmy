Original description:
This is a small mod that adds exactly one item: a Target Dummy.

The dummy can be placed in the world, where it'll stand silently, judging your every action. It'll wiggle funny if you hit it, screaming large numbers of damage at you. It can be dressed up to look even more awesome. This will please the dummy, making the numbers smaller.

TL;DR: target dummies show damage dealt to them and can be equipped with armor

 

Usage:
Right click on a block with a target dummy to place it. He can be rotated 16 different directions depending on the way you face when you place it, similar to an armor stand.

You can start dressing the little dude with all kind of armors and equipment. Just right click him with the desired item. To unequip a certain armor piece just click on his corresponding body part.

Got tired of testing your dps? You can remove the dummy just by shift left clicking him with an empty hand!

 

Additional features:
Have you ever wanted to test your new smite sword but couldn't because there are no skellies around? Well fear no more, you can now equip the dummy with and undead mob head and it will change its type accordingly!
Similarly you can equip him with a turtle helmet to make it a water mob or with a pillager banner to turn it into a pillager mob. Note that he still won't be attacked by other mobs (maybe it a future update), he'll just take more damage from appropriate enchantment and so on.

 

 Need automating? You can dispense the dummy using a dispenser and you can break him by removing the block under his feet.
 

 Don't like how much he swings or the new skin? Well you can easily change that by using the mod config file. You can additionally choose between static and dynamic dps messages and you can make the numbers show hearths instead of damage.
Try shearing the dummies to get a different skin!

 

You can also equip them with a pumpkin or jack o lantern and they'll act as scarecrows, scaring nearby animals
